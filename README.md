# Tracker

> Tracker is an API to track the amount of time a user is spending on common daily tasks. It exposes the api to create, delete, get and update Tasks. The Tasks are organized into three major categories and a user can make CRUD calls to add or remove tasks from them.

## Documentation

### BaseUrl - `https://time-max.herokuapp.com/`

#### The API exposes the following public endpoints

- `get /groups` - retrieve a list of all groups.
- `get /tasks` - retrieve a list of user tasks. This accepts 3 query params as follows
  - `date` - when provided, only the entry for this date will be included in the response.
  - `start` - when provided, entries earlier than this date will not be included in the response
  - `end` - when provided, entries later than this date will not be included in the response.
  ### NOTE: All dates must be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`
  Example response
  ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "A Task",
        "group_id": 2,
        "user_id": 3,
        "entries": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "entry_date": "2021-09-22",
            "task_id": 1,
            "duration": 500
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "entry_date": "2021-09-21",
            "task_id": 1,
            "duration": 200
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  ```
- `get /tasks/:id` - retrieve the task with given id. It also accepts the query params as above.
- `post /groups/:id/tasks/` - create a task with title provided in the body. The only accepted parameter is title.
